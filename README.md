# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Web scraping Mars data

This purpose of this project was to help Robin with her web-scraping project so she can create a web app that will continuously update with the latest news regarding the Mission to Mars, and hopefully help her to land her dream job at NASA someday.  To create the initial web app we helped Robin by building an index.html file that would help provide the layout for her page, as well as writing Python script to set up the routes of her website and scrape in the relevant information related to Mars. 

After initial setup Robin wanted to add some additional images of the hemispheres of Mars to her page, as well as make the site dynamic enough to provide a great user experience no matter what kind of device was being used to view her site.  To grab the desired images we added a for loop to our original script to find the high resolution images of each hemisphere and the title from website Robin wished to retrieve them from, and place them on her page.  Finally we leveraged Bootstrap to make the web app mobile responsive, and we added to two components to make sure that the “scrape” button fit under the title of her page a little better, and we made the button red to match the color of Mars.  With this information able to be updated at any moment Robin will hopefully be able to stay up to speed on the Mission to Mars, as well as provide her site to others that may be interested, including NASA.
